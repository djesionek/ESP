# ESP_NPXL breakout board
This is a breakout board for the ESP-32S (ESP32 chip) and a continuation of the [ESP-NPXL Project](https://github.com/djesionek/ESP-NPXL)

*Work is still in progress*

# Features
Some features that are planned to be added over the old ESP-NPXL project are:

- Integrated FTDI chip and micro USB or USB Type-C connector for easier development
- Integrated LiPo management enabling the chip to charge the battery while connected and seamlessly use its charge after disconnected
- Smaller footprint

# Contributing
Feel free contributing or doing whatever with this design. As board design is only a hobby of mine it's probably 
not a good design anyway ;)
